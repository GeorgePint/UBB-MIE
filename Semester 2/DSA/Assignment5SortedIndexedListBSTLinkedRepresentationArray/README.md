 Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a binary search
 tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or
 from any other library.
 Please do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array),
 but implement the container directly.
