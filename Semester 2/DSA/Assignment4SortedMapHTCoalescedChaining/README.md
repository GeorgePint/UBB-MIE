Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a hashtable with a
 given collision resolution (separate chaining, coalesced chaining, open addressing) as a data structure.
 You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library.
 Please do not implement a separate class for the hashtable (or dynamic array, or anything), but
 implement the container directly.
 If you need tosort elements, you haveto implementyour ownsorting algorithm.
